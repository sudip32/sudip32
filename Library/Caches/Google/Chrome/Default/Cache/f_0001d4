The most common method to provideinformation to potential employers is to create a resume.  A resumecan create a vivid word picture of yourself.<P>The World Wide Web (WWW) has recently became more popular, and isoften considered the newest form of popular media by many people.  Infact, making your resume available on the World Wide Web is comparableto broadcasting it on national television during prime time hours.<P>The most obvious benefit you will immediately receive by making yourresume available on the Web is that you will reach an unlimited numberof people and have opened new doors to audiences you would otherwiseprobably have never reached before.  Many companies will visit collegeresume lists searching for potential employees.  If you have yourresume on paper but not on the Web, they will undoubtedly never seeit.<P>Another benefit of creating an electronic resume is cost.  Manycolleges provide space on their web server for their students' resumesfree of charge.  Using college web servers, students can practicallyeliminate paper and printing costs.  Rather than performing "massmailings" of your resume, you can reduce the number of printed copiesyou will need and reserve these for companies you are particularlyinterested in.  Other benefits you will receive by creating an HTMLresume include:<UL>   <LI> the ability to provide electronic links to your reference and        previous employers as well as providing links to previous jobs        or projects you have been involved with</LI>   <LI> the ability to make updates immediately available</LI>   <LI> ease of maintainability</LI>   <LI> the ability to show that you can adapt to, and use new        technology as it becomes available (a "plus" to many        employers)</LI>   <LI> simply making your resume look more professional</LI></UL><P>By creating your resume using HTML and making it available on theWorld Wide Web, you will improve your chances of getting a job thatbest suits your interests as well as your employer's interests.<P><HR><P><A NAME=steps><H3>   <CENTER>   Writing Your Resume in HTML Format   </CENTER></H3><P><STRONG>   STEP 1:   </STRONG> <P><UL><I>   CREATE YOUR RESUME ON A WORD PROCESSOR AND PRINT IT.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   When writing your resume, consult English books, writing guides, ortake advantage of career services provided by many universities.  Besure to have someone proofread and review your resume.  Manyinstructors in the English department of a University will gladlyproofread your resume, but be sure to give it to him/her enough inadvance to provide enough time to review it and so that it will not bean inconvenience to him/her.  Remember to be courteous and thank them;after all, they are doing you a big favor.  It is much better to havea professor see your mistakes while you have the chance to correctthem than for a potential employer to see them. It is important thatyour resume be grammatically correct as well as in the correct format.Your resume is often the first impression an employer will receive.<P>It will be easier to "htmlify" your resume if you have already createdit.  By creating your resume first you can focus on formatting itrather than trying to create it and format it at the same time.<P><STRONG>   STEP 2:   </STRONG> <P><UL><I>   SAVE YOUR WORD-PROCESSED RESUME IN TEXT (.txt) FORMAT.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   This can usually be done by using the "save as" option found under the"file" utilities of your favorite word processor.  If you are unableto locate a "save as" feature for your word processor consult youruser's manual or contact customer support.  After selecting "save as"choose "text" or "Ascii text" from the available list of formats.  Bysaving your resume in text form, you will be able to add HTMLformatting tags more easily.  Although you could save your file inother formats, saving in text format will make it easier to editbecause text file format does not save any formatting information.Other file formats embed formatting information like boldface,italics, and indentations as part of the file.  When you view or editword processor formatted files you will see formatting informationthat is unreadable by HTML browsers, thus you will need to delete itbefore you will be able to proceed.<P><STRONG>   STEP 3:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   OPEN YOUR TEXT RESUME IN AN EDITOR.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   Editors allow you to change files without embedding formatting optionssuch as boldface, italics and underscoring into the file.  Manyeditors are available to use.  Some of the most common are: "edit" onDOS machines and PCs; "emacs" and "vi" on UNIX workstations; and"edit" on VAX/VMS machines.  You can also use your favorite wordprocessor to open a text file.  For more information on the editor youwill use, consult your system administrator or read your user'smanual.  Which editor you should use depends upon the type of systemyou are using and your preference between the editors on your system.Make sure you use an editor that you are familiar with.  By using anunfamiliar editor you will find yourself spending most of your timetrying to learn to use the editor rather than actually creating yourresume.  Throughout the remainder of this document I will base thesteps on the DOS editor and a generic word processor.<P>To open your resume, first open the editor by typing "edit" at a DOSprompt, or the appropriate command for the editor you intend to use.Next, choose the "Open File" option from the "FILE" menu.  Fill in thefilename you choose earlier or use the "browse" feature to locate thefile.<P><STRONG>   STEP 4:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   ADD THE REQUIRED HTML TAGS.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   Elements of an HTML document are denoted using HTML tags.  An HTML tagusually consists of a left angle bracket (<) a tag name and a rightangle bracket (>).  Tags are also usually paired (e.g. &ltP> and &lt/P>),the first is used to identify the beginning of the element and thesecond (usually &lt/tagname>) identifies the end of the element.  Sometags may also contain additional information.  This information shouldbe placed inside the angle brackets.  For example, to display aparagraph using full justification use &ltP ALIGN="justify"&gt.  HTMLdocuments have a minimum requirement of tags.  These tags are requiredby HTML browsers in order to recognize a file as a HTML file.  Thefollowing is a summary of the required HTML tags:<PRE><STRONG>   Begin Tag   End Tag   Summary </STRONG>   -----------------------------------------------------------------   &lthtml>      &lt/html>   This element informs HTML browsers that the                          following code contains HTML-coded information.                         The file extension .html also indicates an                          HTML document and must be used.  You may replace                          .html by .htm if you are restricted to three                         digit file extensions.   &lthead>      &lt/head>   This element identifies the first section of                          your html.  HTML is broken into two sections,                         the head and the body.  The head section                         contains the title of your document, search                         engine information, and more advanced                         information such as Java functions.  More                         information about Java can be found in the                         "For Further Interests" section of this                         manual.   &lttitle>     &lt/title>  The title is not part of the document text.                          The title is usually used by the browser to                          label the display window.  Some search engines                         also use the title to search on.  The title                         should be kept short and sufficient to identify                         the document.   &ltbody>      &lt/body>   The body element contains the contents of the                          document.  Any information to be displayed in                          the document and any necessary formatting tags                          should be contained inside the body tags.</PRE><P>The required HTML tags must be placed in the appropriate order insideand HTML file.  The following HTML is a simple example of the minimumHTML document.<PRE>   &lthtml><head>   &lttitle>Simple example of an HTML document&lt/title></head>   &ltbody>   &ltP>Information to be displayed is located here.  This will be   displayed as paragraph 1.&lt/P>   &ltP>This will be displayed as paragraph 2.&lt/P>   &lt/body></html></PRE><P>Using indentation can greatly improve the looks of your HTML, make iteasier to read, and make it much easier to maintain.  Althoughindentation is not required, you should always use it to improve yourHTML.  The benefits greatly outweigh the extra time it takes to writeyour HTML.  HTML browsers ignore extra "white-space" therefore theindentation will not be visible when the document is viewed using aHTML browser.  Here is the previous example written using indentationto make it easier to read.<PRE>   &lthtml>     &lthead>       &lttitle>         Simple example of an HTML document       &lt/title>     &lt/head>     &ltbody>       &ltP>         Information to be displayed is located here.         This will be displayed as paragraph 1.       &lt/P>       &ltP>         This will be displayed as paragraph 2.       &lt/P>     &lt/body>   &lt/html></PRE><P><STRONG>   STEP 5:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   ADD ADDITIONAL HTML FORMATTING TAGS AS NECESSARY.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   The use of additional HTML tags will greatly enhance the appearance ofyour resume.  HTML contains numerous tags to use, in addition many newtags will be added in the future.  I could not possibly cover everytag here.  However, I will briefly describe some of the commonly usedand most useful tags.  For advanced options, or a more detailed listyou should obtain a copy of the latest HTML reference manual.  Thismanual can be found on the world wide web at<A HREF="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/html_ref.html">http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/html_ref.html</A>.<P>The following table contains many of the most common and most usefulHTML tags.  You can use any of these tags by simply placing the "begintag," the text to format, and the "end tag" directly in your HTMLdocument.  You will find it useful to view your document as you makechanges.  See step 9 for instructions on how to view your current HTMLdocument.  By doing this, you will become familiar with the effects ofthe tags.<PRE><STRONG>   Begin Tag   End Tag   Summary </STRONG>   -----------------------------------------------------------------   &ltp>         &lt/p>      Separates two blocks of text by denoting a                          paragraph break.  To justify a paragraph,                          use ALIGN="left, right, justify, or indent"                          inside the tag.   &ltb>         &lt/b>      Changes text between tags to a bold font   &ltstrong>    &lt/strong> Logically strengthens the text between the                          tags   &lti>         &lt/i>      Changes text between tags to an italic font   &ltu>         &lt/u>      Underlines text between the tags   &ltul>        &lt/ul>     Defines an unordered list consisting of one                          or more &ltLI> elements   &ltol>        &lt/ol>     Defines an ordered list in which each of                         one or more &ltLI> elements are automatically                         numbered   &ltli>        &lt/li>     Defines a list item.   &lthr>        &lt/hr>     Produces a divider between sections of text   &lttable>     &lt/table>  Defines a series of rows and columns to                          format the placement of text and images                         on the page   &lttr>        &lt/tr>     Defines a row of a table.   &lttd>        &lt/td>     Defines a data cell.  The data cell contains                         the actual text or image that is to be                          displayed in a table cell   &ltcenter>    &lt/center> Centers the text vertically between the                          left and right margins   &ltimg src="..."&gt       Specifies an image file that is to be                          displayed.  The '...' must be replaced                         with the path and filename of the image.                         Additional parameters include:                           ALIGN="alignment option for image"                           ALT="description of image"                           WIDTH="width of image"                           HEIGHT="height of image"                           BORDER="value to specify width of border                             0 indicates no border"   &ltA>         &lt/A>     Defines text as a hypertext link.  The A                        element must have either the HREF or NAME                        attribute defined inside it.                           &ltA HREF="http://url here/"&gtText to display&lt/A>                           &ltA NAME="destination tag"&gtText to display&lt/A>   &ltBQ>        &lt/BQ>    Defines a separated multi-line set of text to be                         rendered as quoted text.   &ltblink>     &lt/blink> Causes the text between the tags to blink.                        This tag is rarely considered professional                        by web developers and therefore should be                        used very sparingly</PRE><P><STRONG>   STEP 6:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   SAVE YOUR RESUME.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   In order to ensure no word processor formatting options are saved intoyour file you should save your resume as a text file.  However, whenyou choose your filename you should give it the .html or .htmextension.  To do this choose "save as" from the "file" menu.  Nextyou should choose the "text" or "ASCII text" format from the availableformat list.  Finally, type your filename in the "filename" input boxas filename.html or filename.htm where "filename" is the name you wishto call your file (e.g. resume.html).<P><STRONG>   STEP 7:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   CREATE AND/OR ACQUIRE ANY IMAGES YOU WANT TO USE IN YOUR RESUME.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   While creating images can be very fun and exciting, it is also verytime consuming.  There are many tools available to help you createyour custom images such as Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop, Corel Draw, andMsPaint.  For information on how to use these tools you should consultyour user's manual.  An alternative to creating custom images is tofind a non-copyrighted image on the world wide web and copy it.  Onemethod of locating useful and free images is to view clipartcollections available on the web such as<A HREF="http://www.caboodles.com/">Caboodles of Clipart</A>. Another method of locating useful images is to use the<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/"> Yahoo search engine</A> and searchfor the image.  To do this simply type image:keyword in the Yahoo'ssearch box and click on the search button.  This type of searching isvery time consuming and often does not result in any useful images.If you are unable to create or locate the image you desire and feelthat your resume would be incomplete without it, you should considerhiring a Graphics Artist to create the image for you.<P>Although images can improve the appearance of your resume, you shoulduse them sparingly.  Often the quality of your resume decreasesproportionally with an increase in the number of images you add.  Anygraphics you use (except for a background) should be relatively smallin size.  Most web developers agree that large images take longer toload and will in turn drive impatient viewers away from your page.  Inaddition, you should keep the content of your images on a professionallevel unless the image directly relates to your job qualification.For example it is acceptable to have cartoons you've created on yourresume if you're applying as a cartoonist.  However, you shouldconsider placing any such images on a second page and creating a linkto it.<P><STRONG>   STEP 8:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   ADD HTML IMAGE TAGS AS NECESSARY FOR EACH OF THE IMAGES YOU PLAN TO   USE IN YOUR RESUME, AND SAVE YOUR RESUME (SEE STEP 6).   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>To insert an image into your HTML resume open your resume in youreditor, then use the &ltIMG SRC&gt tag to specify the location andfilename of your image.  For example, to display an image calledcomputer.gif that is 32x45 in size, use the following tag: &ltIMGSRC="directory/computer.gif" ALT="Computer" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=45BORDER=0&gt.  All images should be in the .GIF or .JPG file format.  Ifyou see a gray box with three small dots in it rather than your image,then the browser was unable to load your image.  Possible causes ofthis problem are: you used an incompatible file format, the image doesnot exist, you did not specify the correct filename or had atypographical error in the directory/filename, or the file permissionswere set incorrectly (UNIX workstations require that you set the filepermissions of an image to 770.  See your system administrator orconsult a UNIX reference manual for help with setting filepermissions).  Be sure to save your resume after you make any changes.<P><STRONG>   STEP 9:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   OPEN YOUR HTML RESUME IN A HTML BROWSER.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   Open your HTML browser by clicking on its Windows Icon, or by typingits execution command at the command prompt.  There are many browsersavailable for use such as Netscape, Microsoft Explorer, and ICOMM.Consult your user's manual for help with using your HTML browser.Open your resume by clicking on the "Open File" option on the "File"menu.  Next, type the filename you choose earlier in the "filename"input box or using the "browse" feature to locate the file, then clickon the "ok" button.  Your resume should be displayed in the browserwindow.  Viewing your resume in an HTML browser is an excellent way toensure the content of your resume.<P><STRONG>   STEP 10:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   REPEAT STEPS 5 THROUGH 9 UNTIL YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH THE APPEARANCE   OF YOUR RESUME.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>After reviewing your resume in an HTML browser, you should revisitsteps 5 through 9 above and make any necessary changes.  Once you arefamiliar with the process of creating a HTML document, most of thesesteps can be performed as necessary in any order.  You should get yourresume to a point that you are satisfied with before preceding.<P><STRONG>   STEP 11:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   TEST ALL OF THE LINKS ON YOUR RESUME.   </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   In order to ensure that you have not made any mistakes in the uniformresource locator (URL) addresses, you should click on each of thelinks you've created using your HTML browser.  Links that do not workare nicknamed "broken links."  Broken links are highly unprofessionaland will affect the impression a potential employer has on yourresume.  Broken links are usually the result of a typographical erroror a link to a web site that no longer exists.  Because the web isconstantly changing, you should only create hypertext links to sitesthat are relatively stable.<P><STRONG>   STEP 12:   </STRONG><P><UL><I>   PUBLISH YOUR RESUME.      </I></UL><P><STRONG>   EXPLANATION:   </STRONG><P>   In order for your resume to be visible to the rest of the world, youmust have current internet provider.  Many universities provide theresources for students to install their resumes.  Contact yourUniversity Webmaster to obtain information.  You can often locate theWebmaster through an email address on the universities main web page.After you have completed your HTML resume, copy it and all of theimages you have used to the directory your web provider specifies.After installing your HTML resume you should always test it.  Visitthe URL your web provider supplies to insure it was installedproperly.<P>You should always respond to potential employers that contact you assoon as possible.  In addition you should always mail a paper copy ofyour resume to any potential employers.  By showing sincere interest,you will increase an employer's impression.<P><HR><P><H3>   <CENTER>   For Further Interest   </CENTER></H3><P><HR><P>"The Source For Java Development." <U>Java Report</U>.

Some of the topics Mr. Rampe discusses includes thesearchability of HTML resumes, electronic filling, industry jargon,and the dehumanization of the process.  Mr. Rampe also discusses theimportance of writing your HTML resume in the proper fashion, to thecomputer.  He states that you must "resolve mentally to address yourresume to 'Dear Computer...' and just ignore the dehumanization of itall."  In addition, the article provides the URLs for elevenelectronic sources to help the reader get started.  Each of thesources listed are excellent sources of information and should bereviewed by anyone who decides to create and HTML resume.  Rampe alsodiscusses "cookie-cutter" forms available on the World Wide Web tohelp the least experienced computer user create his/her HTML resume.<P>In general, Mr. Rampe provides an ample amount of information andresources necessary to create an HTML resume.  Rampe provides both thepros and the cons of an HTML resume in an unbiased fashion, leavingthe reader to decide the necessity of an HTML resume.<P><HR><P>Sandia National Laboratories.  <U>HTML Reference Manual</U>, 2 January1996.  <BR>&nbsp    ( <A HREF="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/html_ref.html"> http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/html_ref.html</A>)<P>Sandia National Laboratories' HTML Reference Manual is, in my opinion,the most complete and useful source of HTML information.  Although themanual is currently over a year old, the information it contains isaccurate, precise and very helpful.  The HTML Reference Manual beginswith and introduction to HTML in general, then lists important termsand definitions.  Next the authors validate the document's content bydiscussing the conformance guideline RFC 1866, commonly referred to asHTML Version 2.  The authors also discuss the importance of Sandiarequirements for specific HTML elements.  Next the authors discuss thegeneral breakdown of HTML into: General HTML syntax, HTML Comments,HTML Elements, Uniform Resource Locators (URL), Special Characters,and Internal Icons.  Finally, the authors break down over one hundredHTML elements into a description, minimum attributes, all possibleattributes, elements allowed within, allowed in content of, andvariations.  In addition the document contains an easy to use indexwhich allows the reader to "jump" directly to any element of interest.<P>The HTML Reference Manual provides the most complete reference manualavailable.  In addition it is well written, well organized and veryeasy to use.  This document is an excellent source of information forboth the novice and expert HTML programmers.<P><HR><P><STRONG>  <I>Authors Note:  </STRONG></I>   Windows, DOS, Paint Shop Pro, MsPaint, Yahoo,  Caf&eacute;, Netscape, ICOMM and Microsoft Internet Explorer are  copyrighted by their respective owners.<P><center><img src="images/marblebar.gif"></center><center><A HREF="engl208.html"><h3>Return to ENGL 208 Main Page</h3></a></center><center><img src="images/marblebar.gif"></center></BODY></HTML>
